#### Script Description Header ####

# File Name: PG&E B-19S-S NEW Tariff Vectors Creator.R
# File Location: "GHG Signal Working Group/Rates/PG&E B-19S-S (NEW)"
# Project: CPUC SGIP GHG Working Group
# Description: Converts PG&E B-19S-S NEW rate into time-series vectors for use in OSESMO's cost and constraint matrices.

#### User Inputs ####

# This script generates a time-series vector for the user's choice of year.
# This value must be input by the user to match the desired year to be modeled.

Data_Year <- 2017

Data_Timestep_Length <- 15 # Timestep length, in minutes

#### Load Packages

# When you first begin using R, packages must be installed. This process only needs to be performed once.

# install.packages("tidyverse")
# install.packages("readr")
# install.packages("openxlsx")

# Packages must be loaded to the library every time you open up RStudio.

library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(openxlsx)
library(lubridate)

# Disable Scientific Notation

options(scipen = 999)

#### Define Working Directories ####

# Set working directory to project directory or source file location manually using Session -> Set Working Directory before running these

Code_WD <- getwd()
Clean_Rate_Data_WD <- file.path(Code_WD, Data_Year)

#### Create Cost Dataframe ####
